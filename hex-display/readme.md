# BitaxeHex display adapter board
This adapater board provides a connection from the BitaxeHex to a 
172x320 SPI interface ST7789 Drive OLED graphic display.  This is 
intended for use on the [bitaxeHex](https://github.com/skot/bitaxeHex).
Currently, the firmware to drive it has not been developed, so this is 
provided in order to facilitate that effort.
